            <h1>PRIVACY POLICY </h1>
            <p>
            In India,HOM is registered as a Private limited company in the state of Mumbai and the laws of India and the courts of Mumbai will have absolute jurisdiction if the member is registered in India. This Privacy Policy applies to all the businesses of HOM and the information that is received by HOM. It does not apply to practices of businesses that we do not own or control or people we do not employ.
            </p>
            <h1> MEMBER INFORMATION: DIRECT & INDIRECT </h1>
            <p>
                Direct Information: When you register or subscribe to any of our services, we collect a wide variety of information about you that can be used to personally identify you as an individual (including but not limited to name, address, telephone number, photograph, etc). We also ask you to provide us with answers to our proprietary questionnaire, and we use your answers to build a personality profile for you so as to be able to match you with other compatible singles. This may contain questions including but not limited to your physical traits, habits, likes, dislikes, personality and views on self, marriage and the kind of partner you are looking for. We display information as provided by you or someone who is acting on your behalf to create your profile, and are in no way responsible for or guarantee the authenticity of the same. It is assumed that the information is accurate and does not misrepresent any facts, and that the person other than yourself who is creating the profile has the permission from you to do so. Once you click on the submit button the information is sent to the administrative department and it may or may not be possible to make any changes to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Indirect Information: This is information that is not directly provided by you and cannot be used to identify you, but one that is obtained as a result of your actions of either directly visiting the HOM website or through a third party link or social media platform. Any time you visit HOM, our servers automatically gather information from your browser including but not limited to IP addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), platform type etc. Similarly, if our services are accessed by the mobile phone, or if any of our applications are downloaded, data regarding the phone type, model, software functionality etc may be collected. This data is used to analyze trends, administer the site, prevent fraud, track visitor movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information.

            <h1>    COOKIES </h1>
            <p>
                We use “cookies” to keep track of some types of information while you are visiting our website or using our services. They also allow us to save user preferences and track user trends. We rely on cookies for the proper operation of our website; therefore if your browser is set to reject all cookies, the website will not function properly. Users who refuse cookies assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that cookies are used only to recollect information sent to your computer from vowsforeternity.com. We CANNOT access any information not sent by our website. Some of our business partners may use cookies on their site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

            <h1>
                PAYMENT INFORMATION & INTERNET SECURITY
            </h1>
            <p> To process purchases, we may require your name, address, phone number, email address and credit card information. Such information is used primarily to process your order or as otherwise described herein. Credit card transactions are processed through industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and/or strong encryption (3DES) by a third party, which only uses your information for that purpose. We do try our best to provide a secure connection; however we cannot guarantee perfect security in the online space and will not accept any unintentional disclosure liabilities.</p>

            <h1>     REFER A FRIEND </h1>
            <p>
                We encourage you to refer a friend to us by sending us a friend’s name and email address. We will keep this information in our database, and send that person a one-time e-mail containing your name and inviting them to visit our site. You agree that you will not abuse this feature by entering names and addresses of those who would not be interested in HOM's services or are not eligible for it.
            </p>
            <h1>    THIRD-PARTIES & SHARING OF PERSONAL DATA</h1>
            <p>Your personal information is not sold to any third party by HOM. We may disclose information you provide when required to do so by law, if we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is required to (1) comply with the law, requests or orders from law enforcement, or any legal process (whether or not such disclosure is required by applicable law); (2) protect or defend HOM's, or a third party’s, rights or property; or (3) protect someone’s health or safety, such as when harm or violence against any person (including you) is feared.</p>
            <p>
                As HOM is a personalized search, it cannot carry out its work without sharing your information and personal details along with any photograph with another member who is considered a potential match. Once information is shared the other person may or may not express an interest in the member whose profile is sent. As it’s a personalised search you will be contacted on a regular basis via email/phone. In addition you may also receive promotional notifications. As it is not possible to provide the personalized search service without severely compromising the service offered to you, therefore we do not offer the option of being able to opt out of this feature.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, every request or interest expressed by you or someone else is sent to our administration section, and is stored for future matchmaking in order to try and find the right match for you. On an ongoing basis HOM may ask a member to provide additional details to improve the services provided. The member is responsible for the authenticity of the information he/she provides as well as the safety of it by using a secure password.
            </p>
            <p>    We also have a discussion board/events page. This can be easily accessed by and is visible to every member. Please exercise caution whilst displaying any personal information in that section, as it may not be possible to remove it later. </p>
            <p> HOM may need to share your information to a trusted third party so that they can assist in providing a service for you. </p>
            <p>HOM may include links to other websites but is not responsible for any third party as each website is governed by its own privacy policies. Equally you may also be able to access your account or content of your account from third party sites, such as social networking sites, by way of various applications. It is important that you make sure that you are comfortable with what their policies are before divulging any information. You need to contact the third party website directly for their privacy policy. Third party operators will have their own cookies and other monitoring tools. HOM is not responsible for any actions once you click on a third party operator link.</p>
